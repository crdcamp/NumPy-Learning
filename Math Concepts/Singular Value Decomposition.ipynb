    "Singular Value Decomposition decomposes a given matrix A into three simpler matrices: U, S, and V^T. When you decompose matrix A, the singular values are the diagonal entries of the <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&#x3A3;</mi> matrix. THey measure how much each corresponding pair of singular vectors (columns of U and V) contributes to reconstructing the original matrix.\n",

    "Feedforward refers to recognition-inference architecture of neural networks. As you already know, artificial neural networks architectures are based on inputs multiplied by weights to obtain outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, recurrent neural networks, or neural networks with loops, allow information from later processing stages to feed back to earlier stages for sequence processing. However, at every stage of inference a feedforward multiplication remains the core, essential for backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, neural networks cannot contain feedback like negative feedback or positive feedback where the outputs feed back to the very same inputs and modify them, as this will form an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, it's not possible to rewind in time to generate an error signal through backpropagation."

    "The dataset contains 60,000 training and 10,000 test images and corresponding labels. Each training and test image is of size 784 (or 28x28 pixels) - this will be your input for the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the image inputs and their labels (supervised learning), your neural network will be trained to learn their features using forward propagation and backpropagation (reverse-mode differentiation). The final output of the network is a vector of 10 scores - one for each handwritten digit image. You will also be evaluate how good your model is at classifying the images on the test set."

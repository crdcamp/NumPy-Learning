    "The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is \"broadcast\" across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.\n",

    "Broadcasting comes up quite often in real world problems. A typical example occurs in the vector quantization algorithm used in information theory, classification, and other areas. The basic operation in VQ finds the closest point in a set of points, called `codes` in VQ jargon, to a given point, called the `observation`. In the very simple, two-dimensional case shown below, the values in `observation` describe the weight and height of an athlete to be classified. The `codes` represent different classes of athletes. Finding the closest point requires calculating the distance between observation and each of the codes. The shortest distance provides the best match. In this example, `codes[0]` is the closest class indicating that the athlete is likely a basketball player."
